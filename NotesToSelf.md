Gameplan for minimal features to start getting feedback:

-  Realtime word counter stats
   -  Progress bar/updates to how close to goal
      -  Also show in badge? And play sound maybe when complete
-  Can set a goal (per day or amount by end date)
-  Graph of words written over time (especially for goal dates)
-  Show stats for individual writing session
   -  Graph of WPM over time
   -  Graph of words written over time
   -  Words added/deleted
   -  Amount closer to goal (+3%)
-  Longer-term stats
   -  Session detection (start and end)
      -  Average session length
      -  Focus(?) minutes (time spent on the document actively writing)
      -  Average active WPM
      -  Stats for average new changes -> words added and words deleted

How is this gonna scale??

-  Store in cloud for longer-term storage?
-  Enable unlimited storage??
-  How much data in general is this going to take up?
